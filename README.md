# Leetcode

This is a log of all the problems that I have solved in Leetcode.

First hint list
===================
17 - Possible approaches are trie, or more easy - building on smaller solution.
23 - Use a data structure which can give you minimum element at low cost.
27 - vector.erase() will not work, as vector overwrites the element everytime erase is called.

Second hint list
=================
17 - Build solution for first k numbers, and modify solution vector for k+1 number.
23 - Use heap (this method uses extra memory)
27 - What if you count the number of occurences in a variable - acting as offset.
